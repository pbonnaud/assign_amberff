# assign_amberff
A script that uses ambertools software to assign the AMBER force field to a molecular model originally in the mol2 format

# How to run the script:

1. As an input, the script need coordinates of a molecular model of a molecule. Free available software can be used for this step. For example, one can use:

    - Avogadro    (https://avogadro.cc/)
    - Avogadro2   (https://www.openchemistry.org/downloads/)
    - VMD         (https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/)
 
2. Run the script with the following command:

$ ./assign_amberff.sh name_of_the_molecular_model.mol2
